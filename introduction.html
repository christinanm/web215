					<ol class="introduction">
						<li><strong>Personal Backgroud:</strong> I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I’ve been a resident of Charlotte for about 3 years now! I currently work as an IT Support Technician. </li>

						<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  I am currently in the AAS program for Full-Stack Programming, which I hope to complete this upcoming year. I’m considering completing an AA degree as well in case I decide on transferring to a 4-year degree, but I’m not sure yet.</li>

						<li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> My interest in computers and IT has been a constant my whole life,
							but I’ve only started programming seriously since the start of my degree here at CPCC.</li> 

						<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong> My primary computer platform is my desktop PC, which runs Windows 11 Home version 23H2.</li> 
                            
						<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking &#38; Why: </strong>
							<ol>
								<li><strong><a href="contract.html">1. WEB215 - Advanced Markup and Scripting:</a></strong> I’m taking this course to learn more about front-end mechanics. It’s also required for my AAS program.</li>
								<li><strong>2. WEB250 - Database Driven Websites:</strong> I’m taking this course to learn how to incorporate SQL into website creation. It’s also required for my AAS program.</li>
								<li><strong>3. CTS240 - Project Management:</strong> I’m taking this course to learn how to better manage and plan projects. It’s also required for my AAS program. </li> 
								<li><strong>4. CSC221 - Advanced Python Programming:</strong> I’m taking this course to hone my skills in advanced Python concepts. It’s also required for my AAS program. </li> 
							</ol>
						<li><strong>Funny/Interesting Fact About Me:</strong> I have a rare blood condition called beta Thalassemia minor, 
							which causes a lack of hemoglobin as well as healthy red blood cells. Harmless for the most part, though!</li>
